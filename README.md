# Hello-World
I'm Anurag Verma from Kolkata, India. I am passionate about designing meaningful, usable and innovative user experiences and interfaces for mobile and web based applications. Currently, I am on a journey to become a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Development is also one of my interests so I am also learning how to code. I believe that these two skills work well together so, I am working towards learning both the skills.
